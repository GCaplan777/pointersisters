    <h1>The Pointer Sisters</h1>

    <p>
      With the recent passing of Bonnie Pointer, I'm compelled to keep celebrating and exploring the rich musical legacy of this iconic sister vocal group. As a child of the 80's, their biggest hits were the soundtrack to my young life. As a young adult, I found their earlier period with Bonnie–their incredible jazz, bebop singing and their amazing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVxv6AFt7YM">covers</a> of America's great composser, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Toussaint">Allen Toussaint</a>. As I grow, I love each period from the Pointer Sisters more so. Putting on "Jump" and "Automatic" and "I'm So Excited" today, with a more refined sense of music production blows me away in how the songs were made–but I also retain that joy from my youth in hearing the songs, waching the videos. These ladies are a gift to all of us.
